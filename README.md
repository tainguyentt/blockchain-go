# Proof-of-Work Blockchain
A proof of concept of Blockchain system using Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

# What we'll do
- Create your own blockchain
- Understand how hashing works in maintaining integrity of the blockchain
- See how new blocks get added
- See how tiebreakers get resolved when multiple nodes generate blocks
- View your blockchain in a web browser
- Write new blocks
- Get a foundational understanding of the blockchain so you can decide where your journey takes you from here!

# Notes
- mining bitcoin = solve a hard math problem
- SHA-256: cryptographic hash

# Packages
- github.com/joho/godotenv: pretty print structs and slices
- github.com/gorilla/mux: write web handlers
- github.com/joho/godotenv: read environment variables from a .env file
